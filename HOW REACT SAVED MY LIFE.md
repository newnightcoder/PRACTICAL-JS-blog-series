**If you are in one of these situations:**
- save the value of some sort of counter and not have it reset to 0 each time you refresh the page
- save the user's input.value somewhere (because you need to)
- keep dynamically created data on the screen AFTER a browser refresh
- or anything like that

**Here is a good read for you!!!**

By the very emphatic title of this postðŸ˜‹ what i really mean is: as a JS learner, React **reactivated** my drive to learn more and make progress in JavaScript + **boosted** my overall coding confidence. React somehow saved my learning journey! that's why i do feel like React pretty much saved my life.

the plan of this article:
- where was i in terms of learning when i started React (quite recently)
- react "philosophy"
- benefits of starting learning React
- words of encouragement


1 - So here is how it all started.

- The trigger:

I was roaming the youtube streets in search of advice and i saw this comment under a great video on the topic of "from vanilla JS to a framework":

![Alt Text](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/f7mp6uv29pyi72iknthr.png)

this is a short snippet of the comment this viewer wrote, but it's the part that stuck to me the most. he had put words onto this thing i had been feeling for a few weeks at this point. "hate" may be a strong word, but i could relate so much! then the viewer explains his journey and it's very interesting. for me personnaly, JavaScript had become difficult, somewhat dry. Or maybe it was the learning journey itself (that was becoming difficult and dry)...
anyways, this very comment sparkled something in me, "i'm not alone!" and quickly: "i'll start react tomorrow!"

- What did i know, code-wise:
in terms of JS, i knew about:
- general syntax (but still learning new things everyday lol)
- dom manipulation 
- fetch from an API + sense of what a promise is (but without being able to explain it like a pro, unlike fetch() lol but fetch is a promise! yes! i'll write about that in an other article.)
- higher order functions (array methods)
- basic knowledge with cli (command-line interface aka terminal).
- OOP basics (object oriented programming) : able to create classes and general understanding of "this" keyword, as long as it was not too tricky. (i like OOP style actually)

- what was i scared or impressed by:
- spread operator 
- destructuring
- using libraries
- react.

- The switch moment:
i received a dm from a dear 100daysOfCode friend, Danny, encouraging me to implement the todo-app i was working on, with a framework. Vue? well, I thought React because that's what i chose to put on my learning roadmap + i was thinking: i'll spend time learning a framework anyway so let me put all my eggs in the same basket, it'll be more time efficient this way, because i learn by doing projects so it still takes me some time to finish one! lol 
So as he said, i finally started to implement my todo app with react (took me 3 weeks or so to feel "ready" lol)
And here i am today, learning React and having a blast!

2 - React "philosophy"

3 - Benefits of starting learning React
- Jump / Progress in JS knowledge

i'm so unimpressed by the spread operator now and i destructure the sh*t out of everything lol! for real!






words of encouragement:
so, yeah, at this point is the moment when you drop everything you were doing and start learning react! absolutely!
But you are in the middle of finishing ANOTHER js project? okay, keep at it BUT implement it with React!
1- open the terminal and type: npx install react
2- create a folder for this very first react project!
3- back to terminal, make sure to locate yourself within this new folder (that's if you didn't create the folder from terminal using the mkdir commandðŸ˜‰) and type:
create-react-app + give a name to your project
4- within your app folder on terminal, type: npm start.
BOOM the magic is starting.

good luck on your journey!!! i'm still at it and having a blast. 
all the best,

see you in the next article.
